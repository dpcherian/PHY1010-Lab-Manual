	abstract = {An experiment is described which studies the dynamical behavior of a soft spring. This experiment has proved valuable as a project in a junior or senior physics laboratory. The results demonstrate the inadequacy of both the elementary formula for the period and the modified formula containing a correction term for the mass of the spring. A simple theoretical model is presented which yields results in agreement with experiment. The analysis uses mathematics that the students have been learning in parallel courses. The simplicity of the experiment serves to highlight the interplay of physics and mathematics. Most physics departments already have the elementary equipment needed.},

Elementary properties such as electrical and optical characteristics are reviewed, followed by the analysis of advanced device structures. With nine additional chapters, the treatment of LEDs has been vastly expanded, including new material on device packaging, reflectors, UV LEDs, III-V nitride materials, solid-state sources for illumination applications, and junction temperature. Radiative and non-radiative recombination dynamics, methods for improving light extraction, high-efficiency and high-power device designs, white-light emitters with wavelength-converting phosphor materials, optical reflectors, and spontaneous recombination in resonant-cavity structures are discussed in detail. With exercises, solutions, and illustrative examples, this textbook will be of interest to scientists and engineers working on LEDs and graduate students in electrical engineering, applied physics, and materials science.},

	abstract = {Abstract Rainbows, halos, coronas, and glories are aesthetic features admired over millennia by man. They are also carriers of useful information about the physical properties of drops and solid particles floating in the atmospheres of Earth and other planets. Although atmospheric optics is a centuries-old discipline, significant progress in the understanding of these phenomena has been achieved during the past 40 years, as well as of their relation to the physical properties of the individual scatterers. At the same time, with the development of planetary exploration, the number of observations of rainbows, halos, and glories in the atmospheres of planets other than Earth is steadily growing. In this article we describe these phenomena and their information content and illustrate them with pictures mostly showing their typical appearance rather than presenting the ‚Äúbest pictures ever.‚Äù},
