\section*{Short Answer Questions \hfill (10 marks)}



\item State Babinet's principle and explain it with the help of an example, describing in detail the diffraction patterns observed.  \hfill \textbf{(1 mark)}

\item It is hypothesised that the following relation holds between the voltage and current of a newly fabricated device :
$$ V = FI^{\beta}               $$
A student who sets out to check this hypothesis presents her data through the following graph (on a log - log scale). Comment on whether the hypothesis is true or not. 

\item A Carey Foster bridge setup is provided to you. The aim is to measure the value of a small unknown resistance which is known to be in the range $0-5$ $\Omega$. You have at your disposal two small unequal standard resistances marked $1$ $\Omega$ and $2$ $\Omega$. Draw out the equivalent Wheatstone bridge and comment if will still be possible to obtain null deflection.

\item What are the smallest and largest lengths that can be theoretically measured by diffraction using light of a wavelength 532 nm. Justify your answer. \hfill \textbf{(2 marks)}



% \item A single slit of width $a$ is placed in the way of a laser. The normalised intensity of the diffraction pattern is plotted against a function ($\pi a \sin\theta / \lambda$) of the angular separation $\theta$ as shown in Figure \ref{intensityPattern}. On the same figure (Figure \ref{intensityPattern}), sketch the pattern if the slit width is doubled. \hfill \textbf{(1 mark)}

\section*{Long Answer Questions \hfill (15 marks)}



\item You are conducting an experiment to measure the time period of a simple pendulum using a \textbf{stopwatch}. At which point of the trajectory would you start counting the number of cycles? 

Now suppose instead that you are using a \textbf{digital sensor} to detect the pendulum's position. At which point of the pendulum's trajectory would you place such a sensor if you want to count the number of cycles?

Justify your answer in both the above cases.  \hfill \textbf{(3 marks)}


\item In the experiment for the Characterisation of an Incandescent Lamp, the circuit is set up as shown in Figure \ref{incandCirc} with a 12V lamp rated at 21W. However, the bulb is found to not glow. Explain why this happens.  \hfill \textbf{(3 marks)}

\item Design an experiment to find the resistance of a fuse (rated 500 mA). You are provided with a power supply ($0-5$V), two digital multimeters, and a resistance ladder. Make sure you mention \textbf{all} necessary details, including the settings of the multimeter, and provide a circuit diagram. \hfill \textbf{(3 marks)}

\item A picture of the Galvanometer used in the Carey Foster bridge experiment is given below. Design an experiment to figure out the least count of the galvanometer. You may use the 2V/1A power supply, a resistance ladder and multimeters.

\item Sketch the IV Characteristics of the circuits represented in Figure \ref{IVChar}. State the units on the axes of the graphs, as well as the rough values of voltage and current which characterise the circuit. \hfill \textbf{(3 marks)}

\item Imagine a string - mass system that can be approximated as a simple pendulum, much like the system we have seen in this laboratory course, wherein a string is attached to the hook of a spherical mass. Assume that the string is not extensible. In order to deduce a relationship between the time period of a pendulum and the mass of the bob, the following bibs are used. Comment on what trend is expected to be seen. 

\item In an experiment using the Carey Foster bridge, it is known that the following equation is true :
$$ R = S + (l_1 - l_2)r $$

When a copper strip is used in one arm, $S=0$. Upon checking for the values of the resistances provided by the resistance box, it is found that $R = R + \delta$. Plot the resulting relation.
