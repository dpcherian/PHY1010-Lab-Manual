\section*{Introduction}
The rainbow is probably one of the most spectacular light shows observed naturally in the sky. The rainbow is produced when sunlight gets diverted to the eye of the observer by the large number of water droplets present in the air on a rainy day. In the case of a primary (or first order) rainbow, the sunlight incident on a raindrop is refracted at the front surface, internally reflected at the back surface and refracted again as it emerges into the air as shown in Figure (\ref{fig:firstorder}). 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \caption{Ray diagram for the formation of a primary (first order) rainbow}
    \label{fig:firstorder}
\end{figure}

The rainbow is composed of different colours, observable in the sky at different angles. This is due to the fact that sunlight is made up of a whole range of colours and light of different colours is refracted by different angles when it passes from one medium to the other. Thus, the light `disperses' as it travels through the drop.

It is possible for sunlight to be reflected internally twice, before exiting the drop. While the intensities of such light rays will be much weaker than those that have been reflected only once, it is possible to see such `secondary' (or second order) rainbows in nature. Secondary rainbows -- as we shall see -- are formed at angles that are further out from their primary counterparts. Thus, we speak of the `order' of a rainbow as the number of times light has been totally internally reflected within the drop. Higher order rainbows are almost never seen naturally, as they are weaker than the background brightness of the sky and are usually positioned inconveniently with respect to the sun; if you are lucky, you can sometimes see the second-order rainbow. 

An instructive way to understand the formation of rainbows is to actually study the dispersion of white light by a spherical water drop. In the present problem, we will study the formation of rainbows of different orders using a suspended drop of a liquid. (Note, however, that we use the word `rainbow' very loosely, to mean a `rainbow like \textit{spectrum}' rather than the more familiar `rainbow' in the sky.) 



\section*{Description}
In \textbf{Part A}, you will study the formation of different order rainbows by a suspended drop of water and measure their angular positions. These rainbows can be observed directly by the eye and their angular positions can be measured using the telescope and the circular scale. From this, the variation of total deviation of the incident light for different orders with the number of order rainbows is studied.

In \textbf{Part B}, you will obtain the rainbows with different liquids and measure the total deviation for the second order rainbow for different liquids.

In \textbf{Part C \textit{(optional)}}, you will use this data to determine the refractive index of the unknown liquid A. 


\section*{Theory}
The geometrical theory of the formation of rainbow requires knowledge of the manner in which a set of parallel rays is reflected and refracted by a spherical droplet of water. It is also the most familiar example of an optical phenomenon known as \textbf{dispersion}, where white light is split into its constituent colours. 

\subsection*{Refraction and dispersion}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figs/snell.png}
    \caption{A ray of light propagating from vacuum into a (denser) medium exhibits a deviation in the angle it makes with the normal (dashed line).}
    \label{fig:snell}
\end{figure}

We will be dealing with the propagation of light between different transparent materials. When light moves from one medium to another, it changes direction through a process known as \textit{refraction}. Thus, at least for the purposes of this experiment, we can characterise different transparent media by their refractive indices: a dimensionless number ($\mu$) which describes how much light bends when it enters the medium from vacuum. The relationships between the angles of `incidence' ($i$) and `refraction' ($r$) (shown in Figure (\ref{fig:snell}) ) is given by the Snell–Descartes law: 

 \begin{equation}
    \mu=\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}
    \label{snell}
 \end{equation}

 or equivalently that,
 
 \begin{equation}
     r = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin i}{\mu}\right)
     \label{rasfnofu}
 \end{equation}

It should occur to you quite immediately that since $\mu$ can take values less than $1$, 


It turns out -- and you will study this in detail later if you take a course on optics -- that the refractive index $\mu$ is not strictly a constant for different wavelengths of light. Since that refractive index varies with wavelength, it follows that the angle by which the different `colours' that sunlight is composed of is refracted by will also vary with wavelength, causing an angular separation of the colours known as angular dispersion.



Consider Figure (\ref{fig:firstorder1}) for first order $(K = 1)$ rainbow formed by a spherical drop of liquid with refractive index $\mu$.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/img3.jpg}
    \caption{Ray diagram for the formation of a first order rainbow, with angles marked.}
    \label{fig:firstorder1}
\end{figure}


Let $RABCS$ be the path of a ray of incident monochromatic light, which comes out of a spherical droplet of liquid after suffering two refractions at $A$ and $C$ and one reflection at $B$.

Let $i$ be the angle of incidence and $r$ be the angle of refraction at $A$. It should be clear to you that $r$ is also the angle of incidence and reflection at $B$. At the point $C$, since the angle of incidence inside the droplet is $r$, the angle of emergence (at $C$) will be $i$. We can then say that the \textit{deviation} of the ray due to refraction at both $A$ and $C$ is $(i-r)$. The deviation of ray due to reflection at $B$ is $(180 - 2r)$. Thus the total deviation is

\begin{equation}
\phi_{1}=2(i-r)+(180-2r)
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/img4.jpg}
    \caption{Ray diagram for the formation of a second order rainbow, with angles marked.}
    \label{fig:secondorder}
\end{figure}

If we now consider the second order rainbow, there will be two internal reflections as shown in Figure (\ref{fig:secondorder}). The deviations due to each of the reflections will be the same, and thus the total deviation due to reflections is $2\times (180 - 2r)$. Similarly for $K^\text{th}$ order rainbow (corresponding to $K$ internal reflections) the deviation is $K\times(180 - 2r)$. As there are only two refractions (one at the point of incidence, and one at the point of emergence), the total deviation $\phi_K$ suffered by the emergent ray after $K$ internal reflections will be

\begin{equation}
    \phi_K = 2(i-r) + K(180-2r)
\end{equation}

or more simply, 

\begin{equation}
    \phi_K = 180K + 2i - 2r(K+1)
    \label{mindevK}
\end{equation}

For the minimum value of $\phi_K,$ we have, $$\frac{\dd\phi_K}{\dd i}=0.$$ That this condition represents the case of minimum deviation is clear from the fact that if $\frac{\dd^2 \phi_K}{\dd i^2}$ is calculated, it is found to be positive. 

Differentiating Equation (\ref{mindevK}), we have

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\dd\phi_{K}}{\dd i}&=2-2\frac{\dd r}{\dd i}-2K\frac{\dd r}{\dd i}\\
&=2-2(K+1)\frac{\dd r}{\dd i}\\
\frac{\dd \phi_{K}}{\dd i}&=0\Rightarrow2-2(K+1)\frac{\dd r}{\dd i}=0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Hence,         
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\dd r}{\dd i}=\frac{1}{K+1}
    \label{mindevcond}
\end{equation}

Thus, for a $K^\text{th}$ order rainbow at the angle of minimum deviation, Equation (\ref{mindevcond}) relates the angle of refraction to the angle of incidence. However, we also know that the angle of refraction and angle of incidence are related by the refractive index of the drop through \textit{Snell’s law}, which states that for a material of refractive index $\mu$, 

 
 Differentiating Equation (\ref{snell}) wrt $i$, we obtain,
 \begin{equation*}
     \cos i = \mu\cos r \frac{dr}{di}
\end{equation*}

Substituting the expression for $\frac{dr}{di}$ from Equation (\ref{mindevcond}) in the above equation, and using the Snell's law relation and the trigonometric identity, $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$, we have
\begin{equation}
\cos i=\frac{\sqrt{\mu^{2}-\sin^{2}i}}{K+1}
\end{equation}
Squaring both sides, and using the same trigonometric identity again, the equation $(K^2 + 2K)\cos^2 i = (\mu^2 - 1)$ is obtained.
Hence, we have
\begin{equation}
    \cos i = \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2 - 1}{K(K+2)}}
    \label{iK}
\end{equation}
 Equation (\ref{iK}) relates the refractive index of a liquid and the angle of incidence for different order rainbows.
 
 However, we do not always have the angle of incidence of light hitting the drop. Thus, we need to find an equation that relates the total deviation $K$ for the $K^\text{th}$ order rainbows to the angle of incidence $i$. This can be got easily, by substituting Equation (\ref{rasfnofu}) in Equation (\ref{mindevK}),
 
 \begin{equation}
     \phi_K = 180K + 2i - 2(K+1)\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin i}{\mu}\right)
 \end{equation}
 
 
\section*{Experimental Setup}

\subsection*{The (modified) spectrometer}

A spectrometer is an optical instrument, which may be used to study the spectrum, dispersion, refraction, reflection etc. It can be used to measure the angles. It consists of four parts: a collimator, a telescope, a prism table and a circular scale disc.

The \textbf{collimator} is used to obtain the parallel beam of light. The collimator is a tube with a lens at the back (called the collimator lens) and an adjustable slit at the front. The distance between the slit and the collimator lens can be adjusted with the help of a knob fixed to its body. The \textbf{telescope} is used to collect and observe parallel light. The telescope is another tube with an arrangement of lenses (called the objective and the eyepiece) at the ends. The distance between the objective and the eyepiece may also be adjusted. The \textbf{prism table} is a circular table with levelling screws, which is mounted at the centre of the circular scale disc. The prism table is used to mount optical components (prisms, obviously, but also gratings, etc.).  The \textbf{circular scale disc} is used to measure and record the position of the telescope arm and thus measures the angle of displacement. The circular scale disc has three scales, a circular main scale and two identical vernier scales. The vernier scales are fixed along two windows to the prism table and the circular main scale moves with telescope arm.  

\textbf{Modifications:} In the modified spectrometer, the mounting base of the collimator arm has been extended to move the collimator away from the circular base and hence increase the range of movement of the telescope. The collimator is provided with an extra adjustable slit mounted externally on its back. This extra slit allows us to block the light falling on one side of the liquid drop so that only one half of the liquid drop is illuminated. The telescope does not have the regular lens arrangement, but instead the eyepiece is replaced by a pinhole and the objective is replaced by a lens of suitable focal length. This is done to obtain a magnified image of the drop. The circular scale disc is kept as it is. 

A specially designed holder is fixed on the prism table, within which a syringe may be clamped. The holder is designed so that when the syringe is clamped properly and the drop is obtained, the drop is seen from all the angular positions of the telescope exactly at the centre of field of view. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figs/img2.jpg}
    \caption{Schematic of the experimental setup}
    \label{fig:experimentalsetup}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Halogen lamp}

A high power (150 W, 24 V) tungsten filament halogen lamp (such as those commonly used in projectors) is provided as a source of white light. This lamp has a small filament, through which a high current (6 A) can be passed. It is mounted in a wooden box, on a stand whose height may be adjusted. The wooden box has four windows through which the light may be observed. A small fan is fixed inside the box to prevent excessive heating. The lamp has a specially designed 24 V (AC) power supply which powers it. The intensity of light emitted by the lamp may be changed on the supply. This is essential for observing the higher order rainbows, as one may need to have white light of higher intensity.

\subsection*{Miscellaneous}
A set of four small syringes, beakers, and Petri dishes are provided. Beakers may be used to store different liquids. Petri dishes can be placed on the prism table and are used to collect the liquid that falls from the syringe. Four different liquids (water, glycerine, clove oil, and an unknown liquid A) are also supplied. A magnifying reading torch is provided to read the circular scale, and a light blocking screen may be used to block the stray light falling on the drop. A spirit level may be used for levelling the prism table.

\subsection*{Useful Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refractive index of water = 1.33
    \item Refractive index of glycerine = 1.47
    \item Refractive index of clove oil = 1.53
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Warnings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid observing the source directly through the telescope for long time.
\item Clamp the syringe on its holder carefully, so that it is held properly.
\item Use different Petri dishes, beakers, and syringes, for different liquids to avoid mixing.
\item Light reflected directly from the external surface of the drop will produce bright white glare spots that will hinder your observations. You will have to account for this and identify the rainbows carefully. 
\item The measurements have to be performed in a dark room.
\item Use only one window of the spectrometer for recording the readings. Use the same one throughout your experiment.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Experimental Problem}
\subsection*{Part A}

\begin{imp}
Begin by determining the least count of the spectrometer.
\end{imp}

Initially level the prism table using a spirit level. Fill the syringe with water and mount it on the holder clamped to the prism table. Keep the Petri dish on the prism table to collect the water drops, which may fall down from the nozzle of the syringe. Obtain a steady drop of water at the nozzle of the syringe. Adjust the height of the syringe such that the drop is seen at the centre of the field of view of the telescope.

Now adjust the alignment of the source, the collimator, the suspended drop, and the telescope, such that the drop is fully illuminated by the parallel beam of light. Partially close the back slit of the collimator so that only the vertical half of the water drop is illuminated by white light.

Keep the telescope, collimator, and the drop in the straight line; you will see white light coming from the central region of the drop. Note the angular position of the telescope at which this happens and treat it as the `direct' reading for further measurements. As stated earlier, this drop will produce rainbows of different orders, which can be observed at different angular positions around the drop. Thus the angular positions of different order rainbows (for water) will be as shown earlier in Figure (\ref{fig:firstorder1}). 

Observe the bright first order rainbow to the right of the drop $(K = 1)$ first by eye and then by telescope. Adjust the telescope such that the bright red line of the spectrum can be seen. Measure the total angle of deviation $\phi_1$. Repeat the above step for the second order rainbow $(K = 2)$ and then for orders up to at least the fifth $(K = 5)$. (In this case you may make the intensity of lamp maximum.) Measure the total angle of deviation $\phi_K$ for different order rainbows. (Note: Before taking readings for each order, adjust the telescope to see the red light of the spectrum.) Plot a graph of  $(K = 1, 2, 3, \hdots)$ against $K$ for the different order rainbows formed due to a water drop.

\subsection*{Part B}
Replace the syringe and Petri dish containing water by the syringe and Petri dish containing glycerine and adjust the syringe to see the glycerine drop from all the positions of the telescope. Measure $\phi_2$ for glycerine. Repeat the above steps, for the clove oil and the given unknown liquid $A$. Determine $\phi_2$ for clove oil and the liquid $A$. Plot a graph of $\cos(\phi_2 / 6)$ against $1/\mu$  water, glycerine and clove oil. 

\begin{imp}
\textbf{Note:} For $\mu = 1$ (air), $\phi_2 = 0$ (theoretically). This can be taken as one of the points for plotting the above graph.
\end{imp}
 

\subsection*{Part C}
Determine the value of $\mu$ for the liquid $A$ by measuring the deviation and extrapolating from the previous graph.
